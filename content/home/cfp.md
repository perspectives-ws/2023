Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: 

* Case studies of difficult, hard-to-evaluate scenarios
* Evaluations with contradicting results
* Showcasing (structural) problems in RS evaluation
* Integration of offline and online experiments
* Multi-Stakeholder evaluation
* Divergence between evaluation goals and what is actually captured by the evaluation
* Nontrivial and unexpected experiences from practitioners

We deliberately solicit papers reporting problems and (negative) experiences regarding RS evaluation, as we consider the reflection on unsuccessful, inadequate, or insufficient evaluations as a fruitful source for yet another perspective on RS evaluation that can spark discussions at the workshop. This also includes papers reporting negative study results. Accordingly, submissions may also address the following
themes: 

(a) “lessons learned” from the successful application of RS evaluation or from “post mortem” analyses describing specific evaluation strategies that failed to uncover decisive elements, <br> 
(b) “overview papers” analyzing patterns of challenges or obstacles to evaluation, <br>
(c) “solution papers” presenting solutions for specific evaluation scenarios, and <br>
(d) “visionary papers” discussing novel and future evaluation aspects will also be considered.


## Submission

We solicit two forms of contributions.
First, we solicit paper submissions that will undergo peer review. Accepted papers will be published and presented at the workshop.
Second, we offer the opportunity to present ideas without a paper submission. In this case, we call for the submission of abstracts which will be reviewed by the workshop organizers. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop, but not published.


### Paper Submissions
We solicit papers with 4 up to 12 pages (excluding references). We do not distinguish between full and short (or position) papers. Papers should be formatted in CEURART's single-column template: https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/, which is also available as an Overleaf template: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw.

Submitted papers must not be under review in any other conference, workshop, or journal at the time of submission. Papers must be submitted through the workshop’s EasyChair page at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=perspectives2023. 

Submissions will undergo single-blind peer review by at least three program committee members and will be selected based on quality, novelty, clarity, and relevance. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work as part of the workshop and will be published as open-access workshop proceedings via ceur-ws.org. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and present the work.


### Abstract Submissions
We solicit abstracts with 200-350 words, submitted through the workshop’s EasyChair page at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=perspectives2023.

The workshop organizers will select abstracts based on quality, clarity, relevance, and their potential to spark interesting discussions during the workshop. Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to present their work during the workshop.
